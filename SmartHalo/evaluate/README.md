## Quick Start

## attribute_accuracy
This is the code for our property correctness test.It relies on several other files, including the matching of state variables, optimized properties, and manually set properties in the source code.

## decom_storage_xls
This file is to extract state variables and types from uncoded decoding.

## esxtract_attribute
This file is the extraction of state variables and attributes in the optimized output.

## optim_state_variable
This file is extracted from the optimized output of state variables and types.

## source_type
This is to extract the properties and types of state variables in the source code.

## type_accurcy
This is the code for our type correctness test.It relies on several other files, including the matching of state variables, optimized type, and manually set type in the source code.
