Based on the additional notes provided regarding the state variables and their usage within different functions, we can refine the annotations for the state variables. This focuses on how these variables relate to specific contract attributes based on their usage in the contract. 

Hereâ€™s the updated annotated code:

mapping (uint256 => uint256) owner_5; // STORAGE[0x5] // Contract Attribute: flag (related to account exclusions)

mapping (uint256 => uint256) _bots; // STORAGE[0x10] // Contract Attribute: flag (indicating presence in bot list)
mapping (uint256 => uint256) __buyMap; // STORAGE[0x11] // Contract Attribute: others
uint256 __maxTxAmount; // STORAGE[0x16] // Contract Attribute: limit (maximum transaction amount)
uint256 __maxWalletSize; // STORAGE[0x17] // Contract Attribute: limit (maximum wallet size)
uint256 __swapTokensAtAmount; // STORAGE[0x18] // Contract Attribute: others (could also imply fees or thresholds)
uint256 _owner; // STORAGE[0x0] bytes 0 to 19 // Contract Attribute: address (owner of the contract)
uint256 _manualswap; // STORAGE[0x12] bytes 0 to 19 // Contract Attribute: flag (for manual token swap control)

```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **owner_5** was updated to indicate its role in account exclusions, which relates more to a flag attribute.
- **stor_6** has been categorized under `limit`, as it is involved in a comparison that implies restrictions on amounts.
- **_bots** is noted as a `flag`, as it indicates an account's presence on a bot list, which can influence whether it is subject to certain roles or restrictions.
- The states of **__maxTxAmount** and **__maxWalletSize** remain categorized under `limit` due to their purpose in limiting transaction sizes and wallet capacities.
- **__swapTokensAtAmount** retains its ambiguous categorization under `others`, as it might involve both operational thresholds and fees depending on the surrounding logic in the contract.
- The attributes are reviewed according to their specific usages in the provided notes, aligning them more closely with their functional roles within the smart contract.
