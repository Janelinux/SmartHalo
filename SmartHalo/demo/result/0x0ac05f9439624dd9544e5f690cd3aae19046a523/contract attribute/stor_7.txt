Based on the additional notes regarding the usage of the state variables, I will update the annotations for the variables in the code. Here's the revised version with annotations reflecting the new insights:

uint256 stor_15_22_22; // STORAGE[0x15] bytes 22 to 22 // Contract Attribute: others
// Events
OwnershipTransferred(address, address);
Approval(address, address, uint256);
Transfer(address, address, uint256);
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **owner_5**: Annotated as `flag` instead of `others` since it is involved in the function `excludeMultipleAccountsFromFees`, which is typically related to limiting the ability to charge fees on specific addresses or accounts.
   
2. **owner_2**: Annotated as `fees`, since it is involved in both reading and writing for fee-related functions.

3. **stor_6**: Annotated as `limit` since it is checked against various values which indicate a limitation on actions.

4. **_bots**: Remains as `flag`, indicating the status of whether an account is identified as a bot, which is often used for flagging certain addresses.

The other annotations remain unchanged as previously established, ensuring that each state variable is correctly categorized based on their inferred usage in the given functions.
