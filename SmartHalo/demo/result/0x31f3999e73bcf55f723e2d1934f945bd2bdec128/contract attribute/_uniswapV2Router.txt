Based on the additional information you provided regarding the usage of the state variables, here is the updated annotation of each state variable with the appropriate contract attribute:

```solidity
mapping (uint256 => uint256) _balanceOf; // STORAGE[0x1] // Contract Attribute: others
mapping (uint256 => mapping (uint256 => uint256)) _allowance; // STORAGE[0x2] // Contract Attribute: others
mapping (uint256 => uint256) _excludedFromMaxWallet_; // STORAGE[0x3] // Contract Attribute: limit
mapping (uint256 => uint256) _ethLiqudityPair; // STORAGE[0x4] // Contract Attribute: asset

uint256 __tTotal; // STORAGE[0xb] // Contract Attribute: asset
uint256 stor_c; // STORAGE[0xc] // Contract Attribute: others
uint256 stor_d; // STORAGE[0xd] // Contract Attribute: others

uint256 _uniswapV2Router; // STORAGE[0x17] bytes 0 to 19 // Contract Attribute: router
uint256 _uniswapV2Pair; // STORAGE[0x19] bytes 0 to 19 // Contract Attribute: router
uint256 _inSwapAndLiquify; // STORAGE[0x19] bytes 20 to 20 // Contract Attribute: flag
uint256 _swapAndLiquifyEnabled; // STORAGE[0x19] bytes 21 to 21 // Contract Attribute: flag

```

### Reasoning for Each Annotation:
- **_balanceOf**: This mapping tracks balances, which could be classified under "others," as it does not fit neatly into any other category.
- **_allowance**: This is related to allowances given for spending on behalf of others, which also fits under "others."
- **_excludedFromMaxWallet_**: This indicates restrictions on maximum wallet sizes, falling under "limit."
- **_ethLiqudityPair**: This mapping relates to liquidity pairs for trading, thus categorized as "asset."
- **_excludedFromTx_**: This maps exclusions from transfer limits, hence a "limit" attribute.
- **_excludedFromTax_**: This variable helps track exclusions from taxes, therefore identified as a "fees" attribute.
- **array_8, array_9, stor_c, stor_d, stor_10, stor_11, stor_12, stor_19_22_22**: Labeled as "others," since their specific purpose isn't clearly related to any of the defined categories.
- **__tTotal**: It indicates the total supply of tokens; thus labeled as "asset."
- **_buyFEE, _sellFEE**: These represent transaction fees when buying and selling, so classified as "fees."
- **__maxWalletToken, __maxTxAmount**: Both of these are limits on wallet sizes and transaction amounts respectively, hence categorized as "limit."
- **_owner, __TEAM_MARKETING_**: Both store addresses relevant to ownership and marketing; therefore, categorized as "address."
- **_uniswapV2Router, _uniswapV2Pair**: These two relate to routing addresses for Uniswap trades, so they are classified under "router."
- **_inSwapAndLiquify, _swapAndLiquifyEnabled**: These variables act as flags for controlling the swap and liquify functionality, thus noted as "flag."

This breakdown reflects their purpose while adhering to the context you provided.
