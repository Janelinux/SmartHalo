     * @dev This function is marked as non-payable, meaning it cannot receive Ether.
     * It simply retrieves the stored implementation address from the state variable.
     * 
     * Execution Logic:
     * 1. The function is defined as public, allowing it to be called from outside the contract.
     * 2. It is marked as view, indicating that it reads data from the state but does not modify it.
     * 3. The function retrieves the value of the `implementationAddress` state variable, 
     *    which holds the address of the implementation contract.
     * 4. The retrieved address is returned as a `uint256` value, which can be cast 
     *    to an Ethereum address if necessary.
