Here is the fine-tuned Solidity code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0; // Specify the Solidity version

contract Distributor {
    // State variable representing the list of distributor addresses
    address[] private distributorAddresses; // The name of the corresponding state variable before the modification:_distributors

    function distribute() public payable {
        uint256 index = 0; // Current index for iteration // The name of the corresponding state variable before the modification:v0
        bool callStatus; // Variable to store the status of the distribution call // The name of the corresponding state variable before the modification:v2
  
        // Loop through the distributor addresses until the end of the list
        while (index < distributorAddresses.length) {
            require(index < distributorAddresses.length, "Index out of bounds."); // Fails if index exceeds limit

            // Ensure the address is a smart contract and can receive funds
            require(distributorAddresses[index].code.length > 0, "Not a contract."); 

            // Attempt to call the distribute function on the contract at the current address
            (callStatus,) = distributorAddresses[index].call{gas: gasleft()}(abi.encodeWithSignature("distribute()"));

            // Verify the call was successful, revert if it failed
            require(callStatus, "Distribution call failed."); 

            index += 1; // Move to the next distributor address
        }
    }
}
```

This code is now wrapped in a contract and will pass compilation with `solc`.
