## Quick Start
Here, we present the evaluation dataset used for our evaluation experiments in Section 5, as well as three vulnerability datasets used for evaluating the effectiveness for downstream tasks in Section 6.

## Evaluation dataset
The evaluation dataset contains 456 pairs of source code and decompiler outputs of functions, randomly selected from a largest open-source smart contract dataset

## interOverflow dataset
The integer overflow dataset contains 50 vulnerable contracts with integer overflow vulnerabilities

## reentrancy dataset
The reentrant dataset includes a total of 81 positive labels for Reentrancy vulnerabilities.

# attack dataset
The attack dataset comprises 18 pairs of attacker and victim contracts from 15 real-world incidents
